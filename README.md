# Admin dashboard project

This is a dashboard project from *The Odin Project* to help students 
better understand css grid and how it differ from flexbox. 
To know how, when and where to use it.

I noticed a clear impluvement in my way of commenting my code. Explaning my decisions rather than just delimiting my code.

I also focus on one side of my project rather than trying to do everything as quicly as possible.
